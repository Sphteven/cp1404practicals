## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've attempted to try different methods to gain better understanding and potentially write more efficient code.

Have to get better at commenting and doc strings but mostly commenting.

What I have been doing well so far have been attempting more on understanding how to properly write better doc strings.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Normally I do the extra practice tasks, I haven't completed last weeks one and will most likely attempt that one and this weeks extra practice as well.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Mostly for me, I'd like a suggestion or ideas on how can I get better at recognising when and how to write comments.

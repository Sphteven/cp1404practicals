# CP1404 Practicals

## Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404


### There are three main lessons that I have learned when it comes to clean code and that is: 

- Concise and proper use of naming conventions is essential when it comes to 
    other users interpreting your code. Without it, it leads to confusion and a lot of time wasted on trying 
    to make sense on what the code is and what it's trying to do.


- Another lesson I learned is that clean code helps you to better read and potentially 
identify in your code through debugging as the more organised your code is, the better it is for you to isolate your 
problem.


- Lastly clean code just overall improves efficiency in development both early and late stages.

Here is a link to the [Programming guide](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki)  to help you get better on developing cleaner code.

# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

60% unfortunately due to being ill for some time. Will look to catch up on lectures.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Recently I've planned to watch my lecture videos on Wednesdays on campus around 10am as I study best when I'm not at home.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I've begun building a new habit around note-taking on my Ipad device and using the app that I have installed to quickly make flash cards to help with reviewing notes etc.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Make sure that I read everything and not skim.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
Again not reading everything.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

At the moment, making sure I haven't been using prior knowledge in completing my prac and using the knowledge currently being taught.
